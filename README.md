## 🛠 Pre-requisites

Time is a big factor, you have **3 hours** to finish **24 questions**. That's **7.5 minutes per question** and they do get progressively harder, so no wasting time on the easier questions. If you’re spending more than 7 mins on questions worth only one or two percent (each question does tell you the percentage it is worth), move on. You won't finish otherwise.

You need to be very comfortable with the following tools, so that you are not wasting time on non task orientated goals.

### tmux

You only get one console, tmux and screen area allowed. This will allow you to split your single console into multiple windows. ie one master, two nodes. Try and use it in your daily workflow to get comfortable with the default settings.

- [ ] **Perform tmux deepdive** - [https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/tmux](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/tmux) - This course teaches you about tmux's pane and window management, session management, copy-paste, and more.

```sh
alias kc='kubectl'
alias kgp='kubectl get pods'
alias kgs='kubectl get svc'
alias kgc='kubectl get componentstatuses'
alias kctx='kubectl config current-context'
alias kcon='kubectl config use-context'

### Courses

If you prefer doing course instead of reading books, here are some courses for you to go through.

- [ ] Do **Cloud Native Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** course - [https://linuxacademy.com/linux/training/course/name/cloud-native-certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka](https://linuxacademy.com/linux/training/course/name/cloud-native-certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka) - This course prepares you for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. You will learn how all of the components of a Kuberenetes cluster work together, how to monitor all components of a cluster, and how to build your own Kubernetes cluster from scratch. We will also cover networking, deploying applications, scheduling pods, logging, and a whole lot of practice in the command line.

- [ ] Do **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests** course - [https://www.udemy.com/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/](https://www.udemy.com/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/) - Prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Administrators Certification with live practice tests right in your browser.

## 💼 The Coal Face

With the CKA being a practical exam, you will need significant experience working with clusters; setting up clusters, fixing clusters, and backing up clusters. Here are several options to get started and more advanced ones as well.

- [ ] Use **Katacoda's Kubernetes Playground** - [https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/playground](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/playground) - This is a Kubernetes playground, a safe place designed for experimenting, exploring and learning Kubernetes. The playground has a pre-configured Kubernetes cluster with two nodes, one configured as the master node and a second worker node.

- [ ] Use **minikube** - [https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/) - minikube implements a local Kubernetes cluster on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

- [ ] Use **MicroK8s** - [https://microk8s.io/](https://microk8s.io/) - MicroK8s is a CNCF certified upstream Kubernetes deployment that runs entirely in your workstation. Being a snap it runs all Kubernetes services natively (i.e. no virtual machines) while packing the entire set of libraries and binaries needed. Installation is limited by how fast you can download a couple of hundred megabytes and the removal of MicroK8s leaves nothing behind.

- [ ] Use **Google Kubernetes Engine** - [https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart) - Kubernetes Engine is a managed, production-ready environment for deploying containerized applications. It brings our latest innovations in developer productivity, resource efficiency, automated operations, and open source flexibility to accelerate your time to market.

## 🎯 Practice Test

This following here is great for a testing scenario. It gives you 24 questions to answer, a terminal, and a timer. You bring the cluster and kube config. It's highly suggest running through this to get comfortable with the test environment as this is the best replica for the test environment out there. It uses the same terminal emulator that the test uses, [https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne](https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne).
